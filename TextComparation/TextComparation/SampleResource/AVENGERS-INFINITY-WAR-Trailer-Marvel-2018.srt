1
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:05,500
There was an idea

1
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,500
 

1
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,759
To bring together a group of remarkable people

1
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,759
 

1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,339
To see if we could become...

1
00:00:15,339 --> 00:00:16,000
 

1
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,179
...something more

1
00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:19,179
 

1
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,420
So when they needed us

1
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,600
 

1
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,520
we could fight the battles...

1
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:26,519
 

1
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,760
that they never could

1
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,320
 

1
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:30,820
 

1
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,259
In time

1
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,079
You'll know what it's like to lose...

1
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:56,100
To feel so desperately that you're right, that to fail all the same.

1
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,280
Dread it!

1
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:05,519
Run from it!

1
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,780
Destiny still arrives.

1
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,480
Evacuate the city.

1
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:22,479
Engage all defences...

1
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,100
and get this man a shield.

1
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:42,099
Fun isn't something one considers the balance in the universe

1
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:49,060
But this does put a smile on my face.

1
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:18,239
Who the hell are you guys?

1
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,900
 

1
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,900
