(SOFT ROCK BALLAD
PLAYING ON CAR STEREO)

1
00:00:06,419 --> 00:00:06,919
(LAUGHING SOFTLY)

1
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:08,960
Mmm.

1
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,240
Hey! Start the car!
Start the car!

1
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,780
Dopinder,
start the fucking car!

1
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,460
Ahh!

1
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,839
-Whoo!
-Oh, I shit my pants.

1
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:22,320
Actually, that may
have been me.

1
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,320
-You're living the dreams, DP.
-Yeah.

1
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,000
-Devil-may-care attitude.
-(CHUCKLES)

1
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,220
Strong thighs.

1
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,520
Beautiful girlfriend.

1
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:36,700
Sorry I'm late.

1
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:38,539
I was rounding up
all the gluten in the world

1
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:39,339
and launching it in space

1
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,900
where it can't not hurt us
ever again.

1
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,260
Kiss me like you miss me, Red.

1
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:52,519
What in the fucksickle
is this?

1
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:57,919
My name's Cable,
I'm here for the kid.

1
00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:00,199
What? The kid?

1
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:01,939
Move or die.

1
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:12,040
Kids give us a chance to be
better than we used to be.

1
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:14,280
He needs you.

1
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,939
You're a lot smarter
than I look.

1
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:18,980
(CHUCKLES)

1
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,120
I ain't letting
Cable kill this kid.

1
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,780
But I can't do this alone.

1
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:25,620
-Boop.
-Can you speak up?

1
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,480
It's hard to hear you with
that pity dick in your mouth.

1
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,039
We're going to form
a super-duper fuckin' group.

1
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,980
We need them tough,
morally flexible

1
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,560
and young enough
to carry their own franchise

1
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,700
for 10 to 12 years.

1
00:01:37,299 --> 00:01:38,700
We will be known as

1
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,659
X-Force.

1
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:40,960
Isn't that
a little derivative?

1
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,539
You're absolutely right.

1
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:45,560
Now let's go get our fuck on.

1
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:48,519
(RAP MUSIC PLAYING)

1
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,020
Tell me they got that
in slow motion.

1
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:03,439
Doing the right thing
is messy.

1
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:07,359
But if you want to fight
for what's right,

1
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:09,780
sometimes you have
to fight dirty.

1
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:15,899
And that is why Sisterhood
of the Traveling Pants

1
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,400
-is pure pornography.
-Huh.

1
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:20,319
God, I wish
I finished college.

1
00:02:22,419 --> 00:02:24,379
It lives up to the hype,
plus, plus.

1
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,819
Fuck it, they probably won't
even make a three.

1
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:28,099
Yeah, why would they?

1
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:29,539
Stop at two. You killed it.

1
00:02:29,539 --> 00:02:30,539
